# 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

# Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

# 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

# 88. Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

Constraints:

- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m, n <= 200
- 1 <= m + n <= 200
- -109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109

# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

Follow up:

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

# 566. Reshape the Matrix

In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]
```

Example 2:
![example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
```

Constraints:

- m == mat.length
- n == mat[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000
- 1 <= r, c <= 300

# 118. Pascal's Triangle

Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

Example 1:

```
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

Constraints:

- <= numRows <= 30

# 36. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:
![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg/250px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png)

```
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false

Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

Constraints:

- board.length == 9
- board[i].length == 9
- board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
