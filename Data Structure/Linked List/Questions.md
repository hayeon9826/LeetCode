# 141. Linked List Cycle

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# 203. Remove Linked List Elements

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Example 1:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/removelinked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 50

# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
