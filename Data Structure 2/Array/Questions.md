# 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 \_ 104
- -3 \_ 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

# 169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 \* 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

# 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105

# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

# 56. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
```

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

# 706. Design HashMap

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the MyHashMap class:

- MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
- void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
- int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
- void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.

Example 1:

```
Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1); // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3); // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2); // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2); // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= key, value <= 106
- At most 104 calls will be made to put, get, and remove.

# 119. Pascal's Triangle II

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

Example 1:

```
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= rowIndex <= 33
