# 231. Power of Two

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

# 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

Example 2:1

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 1111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length 32.

# 190. Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

Constraints:

- The input must be a binary string of length 32
