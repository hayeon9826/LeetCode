# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
![example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

# 77. Combinations

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output:
[
[2,4],
[3,4],
[2,3],
[1,2],
[1,3],
[1,4],
]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 20
- 1 <= k <= n

# 46. Permutations

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 6
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- All the integers of nums are unique.
