# Binary Search

In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a **sorted array**. Binary search compares the target value to the **middle** element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making `O(logn)` comparisons, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.

# Algorithms

This Binary Search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements that is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one comparison.

1. Compare x with the middle element.
2. If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
3. Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.
4. Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.

### Recursive:

```python
def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):

    # Check base case
    if high >= low:

        mid = (high + low) // 2

        # If element is present at the middle itself
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid

        # If element is smaller than mid, then it can only
        # be present in left subarray
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)

        # Else the element can only be present in right subarray
        else:
            return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)

    else:
        # Element is not present in the array
        return -1

```

### Iterative:

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    mid = 0

    while low <= high:

        mid = (high + low) // 2

        # If x is greater, ignore left half
        if arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1

        # If x is smaller, ignore right half
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1

        # means x is present at mid
        else:
            return mid

    # If we reach here, then the element was not present
    return -1
```
